            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>My favorite hobbies are to play football and read books. Reading books gives wings to our imagination and makes us more creative.Football teaches us teamwork and I also enjoy playing it
                . My favorite book series is the diary of a wimpy kid and my favorite football teams are FC Barcelona and Borussia Dortmund. What books do you read?Do you play football?</p>

                MY Inspiration is Lionel Messi. He is widely regarded as the best football player to ever play the game. I like him because of his Dribbling, Vision for passes and goal scoring ability.He also holds many rcords for scroring goals and giving assists. He also has given the most assists in football history.
